    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Ridiculously Easy Rosemary Bread definitely earns its ridiculously easy name but, even better... it's ridiculously delicious!
        <br>Prep Time 15 minutes
        <br>Cook Time 28 minutes
        <br>Total Time 43 minutes</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups bread flour plus extra for shaping</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast traditional</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh finely chopped rosemary</li>
        <li>2 cups room temperature tap water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon flaky sea salt for topping</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium-large bowl, whisk together the bread flour, salt, yeast and rosemary. Make a well in the center and add the water. Mix with a sturdy rubber spatula until all flour is incorporated. Don’t worry, the dough will be wet and sticky, that’s how it should be.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave to rise at room temperature overnight or for up to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>The following morning (or after 8-12 hours), the dough will have risen, but it may still look shaggy and its surface will be covered with bubbles. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 425ºF.</li>
        <li>Spread a generous ¼ cup of flour on a work surface. Dump the dough out onto the floured surface and turn it several times to coat with flour. I like to use a bench or baker's scraper for this. Knead the dough for one minute, adding more flour to the work surface as needed.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 2 or 3 fairly equal portions, turning each piece in the flour to coat. (The bench scraper is also great for cutting the dough).</li>
        <li>Shape each piece into a ball, pulling edges under and pinching together to make a smooth rounded top. Place loaves on prepared pan, smooth side up. If the dough is sticky as you’re shaping, just roll the piece in more of the flour.</li>
        <li>Brush each loaf all over with melted butter. Sprinkle generously with finely chopped rosemary and sea salt.</li>
        <li>Allow bread to rise for about 20 minutes while the oven is preheating. Don't worry if the dough flattens a little while it's resting. It will puff up nicely in the oven.</li>
        <li>Transfer pan to the oven. Bake 23-28 minutes or until nicely golden. Transfer bread to a cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>If making in advance, remove from oven when pale golden brown (about 3-4 minutes less). Cool completely, then freeze on a baking sheet. Once frozen, transfer each loaf to a large ziplock bag and store in the freezer.</li>
        <li>To serve, allow bread to thaw, then heat for 8-10 minutes at 325˚F or until nicely golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
